# Code of Conduct

Adapted from Tidyverse Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
<https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>

## Diversity and inclusivity

Our group should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected and unacceptable behaviour

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the group
Showing empathy towards other group members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by group members include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour

Three strikes policy:

1. If a group member feels uncomfortable with the behavior of another group member, the two parties should first engage in a private discussion about the matter.

2. If unacceptable behavior continues, a group-level meeting will be held about the behavior of the offending group member.

3. If deemed necessary by the group, the unacceptable behavior will be reported to a TA or instructor as needed.

## Consequences for unacceptable behaviour

Consequences will be decided depending on the level of escalation:

1. Settled between the individuals.

2. Decided upon as a group.

3. Decided by the instructor.
